# Udacity FEND Neighborhood Map

[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

This project is from my Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity. The Neighborhood Map is created using `Google Map API` and `FourSquare API`. The code was structured using the M-V-VM model (ie..) `Knockout JS` which is used to develop a single page application featuring a map of my neighborhood, adding additional functionality to this application including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

## Get Started
Click on this [link]() to see the website or you can download or clone the project, and loading up the index.html file in your browser.

##  Motivation
The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

## What I learned from this project
In this project, I learned how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. And then explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for you to use. Finally, I was implement third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.
